The application helps a user to quickly get information about a product they would like to buy and see if it's healthy enough (by scanning product barcode), if it fits in their diet plans, or if it contains something, they are allergic to. This app will provide the user with the opportunity to scan the barcode or label of a product and check whether it is made using sustainable practices. An application like this would be helpful for health-conscious consumers and people trying to stay in shape since they seek greener options.
